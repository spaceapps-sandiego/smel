Social Media Earth Live (Working Title)

The goal of SMEL is to collect information from Social Media and correlate it to NASA's data feeds then provide that information for the user. 

## Running the client
Run the following commands to install the node modules and run the webpack dev server to compile the React client files and watch for changes.
```
cd smel-www/client
npm install
npm run start-dev
```
Open up your browser to localhost:8080 to view the client. The webpack dev server will rebuild and replace code inside your browser when you make changes.
